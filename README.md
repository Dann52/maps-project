# Udacity Maps Project

This website displays a stylized map from google maps with markers from several venues. There is a sidebar which displays the name of the venues.  When one of the markers or the venue name is clicked, an infowindow is opened which displays information from Foursquare.  The list of venues can be filtered using a search box, which also filter the displayed markers. When the hamburger button is clicked, or when the window is resized, the sidebar is hidden/shown accordingly.
